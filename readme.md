# What's this?
A simple application that asynchronously fetches info about PKO BP bank accounts for given credentials.
Username with password and additional sms one time password login flow is assumed.

Mongodb is used as a database.

Fetched account information is available for 24h.

# How?
## Log in to a PKO BP bank account
```
POST /session
```
```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "login": "***",
    "password": "***"
  }
}
```
Returns ```x-session``` header, that has to be used in following one time password request.

## Confirm login with one time password (sms)
```
POST /session/otp
x-session: ***
```
```json
{
  "otp": {
    "code": "***"
  }
}
```
Returns ```x-session``` header that can be used to fetch accounts information.

## Fetch accounts information
```
GET /session/accounts
x-session: ***
```
If accounts data has not been imported yet returns:
```json
{
  "isFailed": false,
  "accounts": []
}
```
If accounts data import failed returns:
```json
{
  "isFailed": true,
  "accounts": []
}
```
After accounts data has been imported successfully returns (example):
```json
{
  "isFailed": false,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Account name",
      "balance": "100.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]
}
```

# How to setup database
